    AtmosphericStability(; name=:AtmosphericStability)

Returns a `ModelingToolkit.System` that computes atmospheric stability parameters
including potential temperature, dry adiabatic lapse rate, and stability classification.

Based on Chapter 16 "Meteorology of the Local Scale" from Seinfeld & Pandis (2006)
"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics", 2nd Edition, pp. 720-760.

Key equations implemented:
- Eq. 16.8: Dry adiabatic lapse rate Γ = g/ĉ_p ≈ 9.76 K/km
- Eq. 16.14: Potential temperature θ = T(p₀/p)^(R/ĉ_p)
- Eq. 16.16-16.18: Stability classification based on ∂θ/∂z

The stability parameter S indicates:
- S > 0: Stable atmosphere (∂θ/∂z > 0)
- S = 0: Neutral atmosphere (∂θ/∂z = 0)
- S < 0: Unstable atmosphere (∂θ/∂z < 0)

Example:
```julia
using ModelingToolkit, EnvironmentalTransport

stab = AtmosphericStability()
sys = mtkcompile(stab)
```
